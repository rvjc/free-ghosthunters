# Ghost Hunters

Many young programmers are introduced to Python via the Python Turtle shell, starting with simple interactive commands before progressing to fully-fledged programs. Of course, games will feature prominently in early programming attempts. Not only are they creative and entertaining, but they are a fertile testing ground for honing your skills and exploring new programming concepts. Ghost Hunters is very much in this mould. Based around Turtle Graphics (which comes as standard with Python), this game is intentionally procedural and is never going to dazzle in the speed stakes. Yet, for all of that, it is surprisingly addictive once you get the hang of it. I co-wrote this over a memorable weekend in 2012 with my youngest son who was nine at the time.

## Requirements

Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.2 for Windows)

## Instructions

You are a ghost hunter in a slow inertial world where direction means everything.
You have to maximise your net earnings before your time or fuel run out.
Ghosts implode at the touch but they are elusive and your movement is restricted.
Each hit adds a bounty to your earnings, but fuel top-ups eat into your cash reserves.
When you complete each level, you get a fuel bonus but ghosts get smaller and more deceptive.
While bounties are more attractive, fuel prices rocket as global supplies run low.
And the more you turn to give chase or avoid energised ghosts, the more fuel you use!

This game is more about strategy, patience and economy than nimble fingers!
Do you use inertia to save fuel and only attack ghosts within pouncing distance?
Do you use early earnings to stock up on fuel while it is still cheap?
Do you later top-up your fuel using money you might not recover?
Do you abandon the hunt and cash-in when you get a good run of luck?

Press LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to rotate and SPACE bar to top-up fuel.
Press F2 to pause/continue game or F3 to abandon hunt and cash-in.

Watch your fuel readout. You turn sickly green when fuel is low!
Beware of fuel spillage when level bonuses and top-ups overflow a full tank!
Hitting an energised ghost (red) wipes out all your fuel and cash, which basically
means GAME OVER.

## Challenge

1. Rewrite this game for a modern GUI framework
2. Employ object-oriented methodologies (classes)
3. Create nicer shapes and background
4. Give this game the sound effects it deserves.
5. Add new twists and turns to have 'em screaming for more.
6. Add a user league table/top scores feature.
6. Write an iPhone/Android version and become an app millionaire!
