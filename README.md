# GhostHunters

Many young programmers get their first introduction to Python via Python Turtle, moving from simple interactive commands to fully-fledged programs. GhostHunters is a surprisingly addictive home-brew game based on Turtle Graphics. It was co-developed with my youngest son over a happy weekend in 2012 when the craic was mighty and our creative juices were flowing.

## Instructions 

You are a ghost hunter in a slow inertial world where direction means everything.
You have to maximise your net earnings before your time or fuel run out.
Ghosts implode at the touch but they are elusive and your movement is restricted.
Each hit adds a bounty to your earnings, but fuel top-ups eat into your cash reserves.
When you complete each level, you get a fuel bonus but ghosts become more deceptive.
While bounties are more attractive, fuel prices rocket as global supplies run low.
And the more you turn to give chase or avoid energised ghosts, the more fuel you use!

This game is more about strategy, patience and economy than nimble fingers!
Do you use inertia to save fuel and only attack ghosts within pouncing distance?
Do you use early earnings to stock up on fuel while it is still cheap?
Do you later top-up your fuel using money you might not recover?
Do you abandon the hunt and cash-in when you get a good run of luck?

Press LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to rotate and SPACE bar to top-up fuel.
Press F2 to pause/continue game or F3 to abandon hunt and cash-in.

Watch your fuel readout. You turn sickly green when fuel is low!
Beware of fuel spillage when level bonuses and top-ups overflow a full tank!
Hitting an energised ghost (red) wipes out all your fuel and cash.
